# Kernel 1
# The first to account for the physical distance from a station to the point of interest.
# For this purpose, use the function distHaversine from the R package geosphere.
?distHaversine

# Kernel 2
# The second to account for the distance between the day a temperature measurement
# was made and the day of interest.

# Kernel 3
# The third to account for the distance between the hour of the day a 
# temperature measurement was made and the hour of interest.
